1. Iterating an Array:
    Linear O(n)
2. Bubble Sort:
    Quadratic O(n^2)
3. Factorial Function:
    Linear O(n) (recursively)
4. Palindrome:
    Linear O(n) (2n, but coefficient's don't count with Big O)
5. Sum Of Divisors:
    Linear O(n) (extra step if divisor, minimal steps for odd numbers -- only 1 extra for prime)
6. Print All Numbers and Sum Pairs:
    Linear O(n) (Again, 2n)
7. Is Prime:
    Either Linear O(n) OR Linear-Logarithmic O(log n)
